Plzimg is a very simple and lightweight web application, without any
database, that lets users upload their images. It is developed in python3
and uses the Flask framework.

It doesn't provide any way to search for uploaded images, or even to list
them.  It is not possible to remove, tag or describe the images.  Just
upload the image, use the URL somewhere, do not lose it, and that’s it.


================
    Install
================
You need python3-flask and python3-pillow (to resize the uploaded images).
Simply create two directories, one for each size of image:
o/ for the original images
s/ for the resized images

You can test the application by running

$ python3 app.py

This will start a test server running on port 5000, but it is not suitable
for production.
If you want to deploy it on your web server, please refer to one of the
methods described on http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/

Deploying per Ansible is possible via [this role](https://github.com/itbane/plzimg).

Make sure the app itself cannot be accessed via the webserver!

Example config:

**/etc/uwsgi/plzimg.ini**
~~~ini
[uwsgi]
socket = 127.0.0.1:5000
master = True
plugin = python
chdir = /usr/local/lib/plzimg
module = app:app
processes = 2
uid = plzimg
gid = plzimg
~~~

**/etc/nginx/sites/img.b4ne.de.conf**
~~~
server {
  # you will want some SSL config, I guess ;-)
  root /usr/local/lib/plzimg/o;
  client_max_body_size 100m; 
  location @pix { 
      include        uwsgi_params; 
      uwsgi_pass     127.0.0.1:5000; 
  } 
  location /s/ { 
        root /usr/local/lib/plzimg; 
  } 
  location / { 
      try_files   $uri @pix; 
  } 
}
~~~
